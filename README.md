# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database-Using-SQL-
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database using creative questions and then wrote SQL queries to pull the data needed to answer the questions successfully. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I wanted to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
